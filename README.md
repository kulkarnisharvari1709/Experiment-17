Program 1 – Creating a Single Node

Objective:
To create a single node in a linked list and display its data.

Software Used:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Concept Overview:
A linked list is a linear data structure made up of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. In this program, we focus on creating a single node with its pointer set to NULL, representing the end of the list.

Algorithm:

Start the program.

Allocate memory for a new node.

Assign data to the node.

Set the node’s next pointer to NULL.

Display the node's data.

End the program.

Conclusion:

A single node was created successfully.

The node contains data and points to NULL, forming the base structure of a linked list.

Program 2 – Inserting Multiple Nodes at the End

Objective:
To insert multiple nodes at the end of a linked list and display the entire list.

Software Used:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Concept Overview:
Appending nodes to the end of a linked list involves creating a new node and connecting it to the last existing node. This demonstrates how linked lists can expand dynamically, without predefined size limitations.

Algorithm:

Start the program.

Input data for a new node.

Allocate memory and create the new node.

If the list is empty, set this node as the head.

If not, traverse to the last node in the list.

Link the last node to the new node.

Repeat the process for additional nodes.

Display the full linked list.

End the program.

Conclusion:

Multiple nodes were successfully added at the end of the list.

The list grows dynamically, showcasing the flexibility of linked lists.

Demonstrates traversal and insertion operations effectively.

Program 3 – Inserting Multiple Nodes at the Beginning

Objective:
To insert multiple nodes at the beginning of a linked list and display the entire list.

Software Used:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Concept Overview:
Inserting nodes at the beginning requires linking the new node to the current head, then updating the head pointer to the new node. This method is efficient for prioritizing recent data entries.

Algorithm:

Start the program.

Input data for a new node.

Allocate memory and create the new node.

Set the new node’s next pointer to point to the current head.

Update the head pointer to the new node.

Repeat the process for additional nodes.

Display the full linked list.

End the program.

Conclusion:

Successfully inserted multiple nodes at the beginning of the list.

Demonstrates efficient insertion at the start.

The head pointer was updated correctly to maintain list integrity.
